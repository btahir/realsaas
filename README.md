# RealSaaS - Next.js SaaS Starter Template

![Demo](https://github.com/btahir/realsaas/blob/main/public/demo.png)

RealSaaS is a starter template for building SaaS products, based on the [Next.js Subscription Payments](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments) starter. This template features improved UX, refined authentication flow, and Lemon Squeezy integration for payments.

> **Note**: This template is based on an older repository and won't be actively maintained. For new projects, consider using the [official Next.js SaaS starter](https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter).

## Features

- Built on a proven Next.js subscription template
- Enhanced user experience and authentication flow
- Lemon Squeezy integration as an alternative to Stripe
- Clean, well-structured codebase
- TypeScript support
- Modern UI components

## Success Story

This template was successfully used to build [SnoopHawk](http://snoophawk.com/), demonstrating its capability in real-world applications. During the development of SnoopHawk, several improvements were made to the original template, including UX enhancements and the integration of Lemon Squeezy as a payment processor.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Purpose

The primary goal of open-sourcing this code is to provide developers with:
- A playground to explore and learn from
- Real-world example of a SaaS implementation
- Reference for integrating Lemon Squeezy with Next.js
- Insights into refined authentication flows

## Important Notes

While this template offers valuable learning opportunities, please note:
- It's based on an older repository
- It won't be actively maintained
- Newer alternatives are available (see the [official Next.js SaaS starter](https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter))
- Evaluate carefully whether it suits your needs before using in production
